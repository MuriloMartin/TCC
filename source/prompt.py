They encompass aspects such as user authentication, data encryption, access controls, and compliance with security standards. In contrast, non-security-related requirements pertain to the general functionality and performance of a system without specific considerations for security. These may include operational features, usability, and system performance metrics that do not inherently involve safeguarding against security risks. \
